# pipenv
# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
# having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
# install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
# poetry.lock is not meant to be committed to version control, and contains system-specific information.
# It is also recommended to add it to your gitignore.
poetry.lock

# pdm
# Similar to poetry.lock, it is generally recommended to ignore pdm.lock in version control.
pdm.lock
# pdm stores its virtual environment in .pdm-python, which should be ignored.
